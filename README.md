Task 9 - This task is about Conditional statements, looping (for and while loops) and error handling or debugging your code. 

I have done Compulsory task 1, as well as Optional Bonus tasks 1 and 2.

Compulsory task 1
Instructions

Follow these steps:
● Create a .js file called controlStructures.js. You don’t have to create an
HTML page for this task. You can write all your output to the console.
● Declare three variables called “num1”, “num2” and “num3”. Assign each
variable a number value.
● Now write a function that compares “num1” and “num2” and displays the
larger value.
● Write a function that determines whether “num1” is odd or even and
displays the result. (Tip: remember the modulus operator %)
● Next, write a JavaScript conditional statement to sort the three numbers
from largest to smallest.
● Write a JavaScript for loop that will display the numbers 0 - 20.
● Now write a JavaScript while loop that will display the numbers 0 - 20.
● Next, create a JavaScript function that will display all even numbers
between 1 and 20.
● Create a JavaScript function that will produce the following output:
*
**
***
****
*****
Use nested loops (i.e. a loop within a loop). Tip: Refer to the example of
nested loops in example.js if you need help to see how a nested loop works.
● Write a JavaScript function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD)
of two positive integers.

Optional Bonus Task 1

Follow these steps:
● Open errors1.js in your task folder.
● Attempt to run the program. You will encounter various errors.
● Fix the errors and then run the program.
● Each time you fix an error, add a comment in the line where you fixed it
and indicate which of the three types of errors it was.
● Save the corrected file.
● Do the same for errors2.js

Optional Bonus Task 2
Follow these steps:
● Create a new JavaScript file called creatingErrors.js.
● Write a program with two compilation errors, a runtime error and a logical
error.
● Next to each error, add a comment that explains what type of error it is
and why it occurs.
