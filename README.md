# HyperionDev Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp - Level 1 - Task 9 - Error Handling

## Description
This task was to help me learn about errors and error handling in Javascript. All the results are printed to the console, so not much to see. Read the instructions below for more details on what this task entailed.

## Instructions
There were 3 parts to this task, a compulsory task and 2 bonus tasks. These were the instructions I was given to guide me:

**Compulsory task 1**
Follow these steps:
* Create a .js file called controlStructures.js. You don’t have to create an HTML page for this task. You can write all your output to the console.
* Declare three variables called “num1”, “num2” and “num3”. Assign each variable a number value.
* Now write a function that compares “num1” and “num2” and displays the larger value.
* Write a function that determines whether “num1” is odd or even and displays the result. (Tip: remember the modulus operator %)
* Next, write a JavaScript conditional statement to sort the three numbers from largest to smallest.
* Write a JavaScript for loop that will display the numbers 0 - 20.
* Now write a JavaScript while loop that will display the numbers 0 - 20.
* Next, create a JavaScript function that will display all even numbers between 1 and 20.
* Create a JavaScript function that will produce the following output:
```

*
**
***
****
***** 
```

* Use nested loops (i.e. a loop within a loop). Tip: Refer to the example of nested loops in example.js if you need help to see how a nested loop works.
* Write a JavaScript function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers.

**Optional Bonus Task 1**
Follow these steps:
* Open errors1.js in your task folder.
* Attempt to run the program. You will encounter various errors.
* Fix the errors and then run the program.
* Each time you fix an error, add a comment in the line where you fixed it and indicate which of the three types of errors it was.
* Save the corrected file.
* Do the same for errors2.js

**Optional Bonus Task 2**
Follow these steps:
* Create a new JavaScript file called creatingErrors.js.
* Write a program with two compilation errors, a runtime error and a logical error.
* Next to each error, add a comment that explains what type of error it is and why it occurs.

### Technologies
This project uses:
* Javascript ECMAScript 2021

## Installation
This project created Javascript, so it needs no special installation. Simply inspect the code for each of the Javascript files.

## Usage 
Nothing to do really. Just view the Javascript code in each of the files to get an idea of what was being done.
